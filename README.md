# Machine-Learning-Based-Risk-Models-for-Procedural-Complications-of-RFA-for-AF-patients
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with risk of complications. This study aimed to develop and validate risk models for predicting complication after radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation patients.
